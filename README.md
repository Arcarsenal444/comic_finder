# comic_finder
An application to recommend comic book titles to people who have never read comics but are interested.

### what it is

This was created in fall 2024 as a semester project for my Intro to Python class. Because the project stipulations included using a wide variety of select libraries and modules, this became something of a Frankenstein agglomeration that incorporates a great deal of extraneous utility that would not be part of a commercial model. The envisioned user is a person who has never read comic books but is apt to investigate and would like assistance choosing titles that would match a set of interests. By asking a number of questions, the application zeroes in on a number of titles to recommend.

### modules incorporated

1. tkinter
2. random
3. datetime
4. webbrowser
